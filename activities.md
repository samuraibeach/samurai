> Only 2.5 hours north of Sydney, Port Stephens is a coastal desert wilderness with golden sand beaches, crystal waters, hot summers and mild winters. Explore one of the 26 fabulous beaches and bay-side coastal areas.

Port Stephens waterway is around 2.5 times larger than the Sydney Harbour and is considered the 'Dolphin Capital' of Australia. 150 Bottlenose dolphins live in and around the Bay. Dolphin watching cruises are abundant and wildly popular. From May to November, over 1,000 Humpbacks migrate past Port Stephens and the Whale Watching/Dolphin Watching combination tours are spectacular.

Ahoy! Sail & whale watch, dolphin spot, and cruise; parasail, wake board, rent a boat or Jet-Ski.

The Stockton Sand Dunes, part of the [Worimi Aboriginal]() Conservation lands, make up the biggest sand mass in the Southern Hemisphere and stretch over 30 kms from Anna Bay to Newcastle. Landscape views from the dunes are spectacular, and the shore line is impressive. Explore the dunes by foot, camel, 4WD, horse, or Quad Bike. Major attractions include the Sygna Ship Wreck and 'Tin City' a community living in the dunes.

[Tomaree National Park](https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/things-to-do/walking-tracks/tomaree-head-summit-walk "Tomaree") fringes the towns of Nelson Bay, Shoal Bay, Boat Harbour and Anna Bay. The National Park conserves 2318 hectares of sand dunes, heathland, forested areas, and over 20km of rocky coastline and beaches. Important flora and fauna habitats are protected as well as Aboriginal cultural heritage. Exploring the park by foot or bicycle is easy via the trail system and is the best way to spot native animals - Koalas, Kangaroos, Wallabys, and birdlife.

Beach hike to the Lighthouse, climb Tomaree Headlands, bush walk in Tomaree National Park.
