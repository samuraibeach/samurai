### Backpacker Bunk Rooms

**SAMURAI YHA Backpackers Resort** is a choice place to hang your backpack for a while. Unwind, meet travellers, and sleep in one of our comfortable Backpacker Bunk Rooms.

Fully equipped with backpacker essentials—linens, pillows, doonas, blankets, shared refrigerator, fan, heater and hot water bottles in winter—these five or six-share hostel rooms are spacious, clean, cheap, and seriously cosy.

Relax, chat, or just lounge and enjoy the garden view from the wide verandah; even feed the friendly possum Pete who hangs around.

_Those Under 17 years of age not permitted in Backpacker Bunk Rooms._
