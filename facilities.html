            <p>It’s like eating in the middle of the Rainforest but not getting wet when it rains…</p>

            <p>Eat out… side. Cook, feast, drink, and meet other travellers in our spacious, open-air eatery. It is a
                fully
                equipped bush kitchen, with a large BBQ, gas cooker, microwave, toaster, sandwich maker, espresso
                makers,
                and
                more. We also provide necessary cooking equipment and free tea, coffee, sugar, flour, oil and salt.
                Surrounded
                by rainforest and native wildlife, the Bush Kitchen seems surreal. With a large wooden deck and
                community-style
                seating, the atmosphere is a rare blend of tranquillity and comradery. And now we have added a lovely
                little
                chiminea fire pot to snuggle around on the cold winter nights..</p>

            <p>Has to be seen to be believed. - Lonely Planet<br>
                A proper Aussie “Shed” packed with historical, unnecessary, and first-class stuff. There’s a free pool
                table, a
                dart board, TV, DVD player, Wii, board games, free book exchange, a travel library,and CD player.
                Excellent
                spot
                to relax, read, or join in traveller revelry. Maybe you will be here when we host our Movie and popcorn
                night.
