### An oasis for mellow travellers...

Located only 2.5 hrs north of Sydney and 10 minutes away from Nelson Bay, SAMURAI PORT STEPHENS YHA Backpackers is a great spot to stop on your travels along the East Coast backpacker trail or to escape the city for a few days. SAMURAI accommodates guests in rustic bungalows surrounded by jungle gardens. There is a laid-back and welcoming atmosphere—where the Staff knows your name and it’s easy to meet other travellers. Lounge around The Lagoon-style pool, hang out in The Shed,  mingle in the large deck style bush kitchen  or sit back and spot wildlife from the open verandas. SAMURAI PORT STEPHENS YHA caters for a variety of guests with bunk-style Backpacker Rooms, Double Rooms, Triples, Family and Ensuite Double Rooms.

### Wildlife

SAMURAI YHA Backpackers is situated directly along the koala corridor, and we often have koalas visiting the property. Other ‘wild’ guests include kookaburras, Pete the friendly Possum, and our resident Diamond Python

Near to 26 excellent beaches, the Worimi Conservation Lands and sand dunes, Great Lakes Marine Park, and Tomaree National Park—SAMURAI Backpackers is a nature lover’s paradise.

We can direct you to or organize: bush walks, mountain biking, surfing, dolphin watching, snorkelling/diving, boating and more.
