### Surfing

Whether it's hanging five or hanging out Port Stephens has some great beaches for surfing.

Surfing lessons being on a peninsula quality waves can almost always be found on our many ocean beaches with uncrowded breaks perfect for the learner or the experienced.

Surf school lessons starting from $60 for a 2hr lesson are available at Birubi or Fingal and at One Mile. They also have board hire for those that don't need a lesson.

We also offer free use of our Samurai bodyboards for some great fun in the surf.
