### Surfing
Whether it's hanging five or hanging out Port Stephens has some great beaches for surfing.

Surfing lessonsBeing on a peninsula quality waves can almost always be found on our many ocean beaches with uncrowded breaks perfect for the learner or the experienced.

2 Surf schools starting from $55 for a 2hr lesson are available at Birubi or Fingal and at One Mile. They also have board hire for those that don't need a lesson.

Check at the surf schools at Port Stephens Learn to Surf or Anna Bay Surf School and if you are keen we can book for you at our reception.

We also offer free use of our Samurai bodyboards for some great fun in the surf.

Check with us for the best tips on the day as the best breaks are tide/swell dependant.
