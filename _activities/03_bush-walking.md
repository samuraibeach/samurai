### Bush Walking

Your chance to explore the diversity of Tomaree National Park

Tomaree National Park in and around Port Stephens covers 2266 hectares of coastal bushland.
For those who like to bushwalk, Tomaree National Park offers some great walks, especially the climb up to the top of Tomaree Headland which offers spectacular views of Port Stephens all the way to Broughton Island and is the perfect location to spot the migrating whales in winter.
More details can be found at http://nationalparks.nsw.gov.au Check with us in reception as we can give you copies of maps with walks around the area.
