###  Sand Dunes

Where the sand dunes meets the sea... Visit the Stockton Sand Dunes and Worimi Conservation Lands for wild adventures and view spectacular landscapes.

Stockton Beach, located at Anna Bay is a adventure paradise. A 35km long beach with breathtaking sand dunes and endless waves.

We have custom made "SAMURAI sandboards" available from the office free for guests.  You chance to climb the dunes to slide down on the boards...not for the faint hearted.

The dunes offer great photo opportunities and a chance to explore this coastal wilderness.

The dunes are a buzz with activites on offer to suit everyone from a photogenic Camel Ride along the beach to horse rides or the faster mode of 4WD tours.  You can even jump on a Quad bike for those who are after the adrenalin fix.
