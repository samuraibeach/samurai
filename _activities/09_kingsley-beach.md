### Kingsley Beach

Kingsley Beach is one of our favourite little beaches, hidden away inside Tomaree National Park, out near Boat Harbour.
A great beach for a small wave, a chance to spot dolphins, but best of all is Jump Rock.
Watch the locals launch themselves off the rock, then dare out to have ago yourself.
Watch the tides....pack a picnic and spend a day.
