### Riding on the Beach

Cantering along the beach with the wind in your hair, no it's not a dream. Come and try it on Stockton Beach, whether on Horseback or Camel back.

Whether riding through the bush or on the beach is your desire there are **Sahara Trails** offers a variety of rides. Rides vary in price depending on style but on average a bush ride is $55 or a beach ride is $120 or $80 for 1 hour ride.  Can't you just picture yourself cantering along the beach with the wind in your hair....

Or you can grab a photo opportunity and have a **Camel** Ride, only $25 and available only on weekends.
