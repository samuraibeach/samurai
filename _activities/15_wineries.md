### Wineries

2 local wineries which offer some quality wine and beer or jump on a tour to the Hunter Valley,

In Port Stephens we are lucky enough to have 2 quality local wineries open to the public. Murrays and Wonganella are located on Nelson Bay road right next to each other. Murrays has a quality cafe attached to the winery. This also the home of the  Murray's Brewery, test some local boutique beers (the Whale Ale or Angry Man is recommended).  Wonganella is the winery with the view and has a great restaurant open for lunch that looks out over Port Stephens.
