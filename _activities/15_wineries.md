### Wineries
3 local wineries which offer some quality wines or jump on a tour to the Hunter Valley,


In Port Stephens we are lucky enough to have 3 quality local wineries open to the public. Port Stephens Winery and Wonganella are located on Nelson Bay road right next to each other. Port Stephens Wineries has won numerous tourism awards and has a quality cafe attached to the winery. This also the home of the new Murray's Brewery, test some local boutique beers (the Whale Ale is recommended).  Wonganella is the winery with the view and has a great restaurant open for lunch that looks out over Port Stephens.
But for those who wish to visit the HUNTER valley wineries check out our Backpacker Special Offer which is a full day tour with pick up and drop off from our door, morning tea, chocolate and cheese and olive tasting. A full day for all, you can check out more at HADES Tours.
