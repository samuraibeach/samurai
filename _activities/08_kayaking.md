### Kayaking

Get wet! Kayak the Bay and explore Port Stephens the eco-friendly way...

Explore Port Stephens waterways with a guided kayaking tour. Paddle around the headlands and through the Halifax Nature Reserve; spot native wildlife - dolphins, sea turtles, penguins, and birds of prey. The local guide knows the tides, area history, helps to identify the local plant and wildlife, and often takes visitors to Aboriginal Heritage Sites.

Port Stephens Kayaking offers affordable 1 - 2 hour paddles as well as a Sunset Tour that includes a free glass of champagne.

"This is the only activity I want to do when I visit Port Stephens." - Jonathan / Randwick, NS
