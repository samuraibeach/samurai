Get on your bike (or ours) and explore the beauty of Port Stephens at your own pace.

For the cycling enthusiast Port Stephens is fortunate that most of the area is relatively flat with an excellent network of cycleways linking our awesome array of natural features, a great way to explore the area.There are many great cycle ways with great views. At Samurai we have mountain bikes available for hire from $2 per hour up to a maximum of $15 per day including helmet and chain lock or supermarket bikes for free. AS long time locals we are able to give you some great ideas of where to go to highlight the ride. A great healthy and enviromentally friendly way to explore Port Stephens.
