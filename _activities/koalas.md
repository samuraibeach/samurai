### Koalas
You don't have to go far, Samurai Beach Bungalows is located in a koala corrider and they are often spotted from the bungalows

These cute and cuddly animals can be found in numerous places around Port Stephens. We are extremely lucky at Samurai Beach Bungalows as weare located in a koala corridor which means we can nearly always find the koalas. Mating season usually starts around August and the grunting males can be heard most nights for many months. Other options are to visit the Habitat at Tanilba Bay which also offers guided walks or Oakvale Farm where you can get in with the Koalas at either 11am or 2pm for a photo.
